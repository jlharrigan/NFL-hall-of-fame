    "The ultimate recognition for an NFL player is to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Only 1.2% of NFL players can call themselves Hall of Famers. While the avid football fan knows more than just this small fraction of players, Hall of Famers are the household names. They have influence way beyond their playing days and way outside the sphere of football.\n",

Troy Polamalu, one of the all-time great safeties for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is still seen in Head & Shoulder's ads because of his famous, curly hair. Peyton Manning may be one of the prime examples of this. He was just the host of the Country Music Awards, acted in the animated movie 'Ferdinand' and has endorsement deals with various companies. \n",
